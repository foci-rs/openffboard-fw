//! Probe-free panic and HardFault capture.
//!
//! Persists the fault into a no-init CCMRAM record that survives the warm
//! reset, then hands it to [`foci_firmware::diagnostic`] at startup so the
//! connect-time register dump reports it to the host over the ordinary command
//! transport.
//!
//! CCMRAM (0x1000_0000) is core-coupled RAM the startup code never clears; it
//! retains its contents across an `SCB::sys_reset` or watchdog reset while
//! power is held. The 32-bit magic guards against reading uninitialised RAM as
//! a record on the first cold boot.
//!
//! The record carries no message string: a Rust panic is located by its source
//! `line` plus the FNV-1a `file_hash` of the panic path (match against hashed
//! candidate paths), and a HardFault by its `pc` (resolve with `addr2line`
//! against the ELF). That keeps the wire reply a fixed scalar layout.
