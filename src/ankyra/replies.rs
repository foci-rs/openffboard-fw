//! `#[klipper_reply]` struct declarations for openffboard-fw.
//!
//! Each struct in this module is a reply shape that a `#[klipper_command]`
//! handler (or Task 8's background reply emitters) sends back to the
//! Klipper host via `::ankyra::klipper_reply!(Path, field: ty = expr, ...)`.
//!
//! # Wire-name preservation
//!
//! Ankyra derives the protocol name from the struct identifier and
//! automatically converts PascalCase idents to `snake_case` on the wire
//! (e.g. `TrsyncState` → `trsync_state`). Struct names in this module
//! therefore use idiomatic Rust PascalCase while preserving the
//! on-the-wire protocol names expected by the Klipper host.

use ankyra::prelude::klipper_reply;

/// `trsync_state` reply — emitted by the trigger subsystem as trsync
/// snapshots are drained.
///
/// Ankyra emits the wire name `trsync_state` via the automatic
/// PascalCase-to-snake_case conversion.
